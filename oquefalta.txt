Dashboard page
Add a summary page under “Dashboards” showing:
Total processes stored, recent publications, per‑CNPJ counts, and trend by publish_date.
Also add “how many portals the customer has” (we can wire to your existing tenants/portals tables if present; otherwise stub, then hook).
Consultas history and drilldown
“Histórico de consultas” list: shows recent consultations (document, date, dataset).
A detail view: pretty table + filters + export to CSV/JSON.
Integrations > BigDataCorp (like Configuração ASAAS)
Add a live form on Integracoes.tsx to set TokenId and AccessToken from the frontend:
Store in Supabase settings/integrations table (I can add a table public.integrations_settings if you don’t already have one).
On the backend, read from Supabase on every request or cache temporarily.
After saving, show the datasets available (for now, we’ll list the core ones you gave; later we can request from BigData docs to enumerate).
Update the “Integrações” link under dashboard to redirect to the “Docs” view for now.
“Criar Carteira”
CSV/XLSX 1‑column importer (CPF/CNPJ) with a stepper UI and a backend endpoint that normalizes identifiers and creates a carteira + entries.
Option to use a Carteira to prefill the Consultas input.
What you need to do right now

Apply the new Supabase tables
In your Supabase SQL editor, run the migration file:
app/supabase/migrations/20250911000000_processes_table.sql
Note: consultations table already exists from earlier migration (app/supabase/migrations/20250909043000_...).
Verify persistence
Run a CNPJ consulta again.
Check Supabase:
select document, dataset, requested_at from public.consultations order by requested_at desc
select count(*) from public.processes
select document, count(*) from public.processes group by document order by count desc
Open questions to confirm before I wire the rest

Where in Supabase should I store integration tokens? I can create public.integrations_settings with columns:
id uuid, tenant_id text, name text (e.g., 'bigdatacorp'), data jsonb (stores tokenId, accessToken), created_at, updated_at
Dashboards: Do you want tenant‑scoped views by default? If so, tell me how to resolve the tenant context in the app (cookie, header, or chosen company).
